Strategy Design Pattern
=======================

Is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of
implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family
of algorithms to use.

For instance, a class that performs validation on incoming data may use the strategy pattern to select
a validation algorithm depending on the type of data, the source of the data, user choice, or other
discriminating factors. These factors are not known until run-time and may require radically different
validation to be performed. The validation algorithms (strategies), encapsulated separately from the
validating object, may be used by other validating objects in different areas of the
system (or even different systems) without code duplication.


"Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them and makes them interchangeable."
