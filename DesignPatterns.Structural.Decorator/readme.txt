Decorator Design Pattern
========================

Decorator pattern is used to add new functionality to an existing object without changing its
structure. Hence Decorator pattern provides an alternative way to inheritance for modifying
the behavior of an object.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and add new behaviors/operations
to an object at run-time.
